Little script to list global non intrinsic js variables to help keep your scripts clean. 

Based on an idea by Remy Sharp http://remysharp.com/2007/11/01/detect-global-variables/ about creating an iframe and then comparing contents to main window to easily exclude intrinsic window objects.

Tested just in Chrome at present.

See index.htm for usage example.
